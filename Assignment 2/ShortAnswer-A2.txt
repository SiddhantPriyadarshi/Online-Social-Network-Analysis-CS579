1. Looking at the top errors printed by get_top_misclassified, name two ways you would modify your classifier to improve accuracy (it could be features, tokenization or something else.)

There are various ways to improve the accuracy which are as follows:
A.  Elimination of the stop words like a, an, the, and and many more.
B.  Words having low chances of occurrence or frequency can we omitted.
C.  We can transform the documents into TD-IDF vectors.
D.  For improving the accuracy of the model we can make use of other available text classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Deep Neural Networks.
E.  Also tuning few of the parameters of the model can help in considerably improving the frequency.
Here in this assignment KFold parameter has been assigned a default value of 5. The model’s performance can be checked with values of 10, 15 , … (keeping in mind that the model doesn’t overfit).

2. Implement one of the above methods. How did it affect the results?

We run the model with different KFold  values.

#### K = 5

Mean Accuracies per Setting:
features=token_pair_features lexicon_features: 0.75125
features=token_features token_pair_features lexicon_features: 0.74583
features=token_features token_pair_features: 0.73542
features=token_pair_features: 0.72875
min_freq=2: 0.72250
punct=False: 0.72024
min_freq=5: 0.71857
punct=True: 0.70810
min_freq=10: 0.70143
features=token_features lexicon_features: 0.69667
features=token_features: 0.69000
features=lexicon_features: 0.65125
testing accuracy=0.730000

#### K = 10

Mean Accuracies per Setting:
features=token_pair_features lexicon_features: 0.75458
features=token_features token_pair_features lexicon_features: 0.75000
features=token_features token_pair_features: 0.74000
features=token_pair_features: 0.73625
punct=False: 0.72452
min_freq=5: 0.72232
min_freq=2: 0.72054
min_freq=10: 0.71250
punct=True: 0.71238
features=token_features lexicon_features: 0.70208
features=token_features: 0.69000
features=lexicon_features: 0.65625
testing accuracy=0.780000

#### K = 15

We can observe the moment we change the value of K from 5 to 10, there is a change in the performance of the model.
